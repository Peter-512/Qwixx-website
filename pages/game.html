			<h2>Object of the game</h2><br>
			<p>Score the most points by crossing out as many numbers in the four rows as possible while avoiding
			   penalty points.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="rules">
			<h2>Game Play</h2>
			<ul class="rule">
				<li>The players take alternating "active" turns. The active player rolls all six
					dice. The following two actions are now carried out in order, always one after the other:
				</li>
				<li>
					The two public dice with the black border are added together.
					All players may (but do <em>not</em> have to) then cross out the number of that result in any one of
					the rows.
				</li>
				<li>
					The active player (but not the others) can then add one of the public dice to any of the colored
					dice and cross off the number corresponding to this total in the row corresponding to the
					color of the chosen colored die.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Penalties</h2>
			<ul class="rule">
				<li>
					If the active player does not cross out at least one number after the two acts, he must take
					a penalty. Each penalty is worth -5 points.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Crossing out a number</h2>
			<ul class="rule">
				<li>
					When a number is crossed out, all the numbers to the left of that number in the same row get
					disabled,
					meaning the player won't be able to cross them out anymore.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Locking a Row</h2>
			<ul class="rule">
				<li>
					To cross out the number at the far right end of a row (red 12, yellow 12, green 2, blue 2),
					you must first cross out at least five numbers in that row.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you cross out the number on the far right, you must also cross out the lock symbol immediately
					adjacent to it. This means that the row is now locked for all players, and that numbers
					in this color may no longer be crossed out in subsequent rounds.
				</li>
				<li>
					Additionally, the same colored die is removed from the game as well, as it serves no purpose
					anymore.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Scoring</h2>
			<ul class="rule">
				<li>
					Every time a number gets crossed out, the player gains points in the amount of numbers he now has crossed out in that row.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>End</h2>
			<ul class="rule">

			</ul>

			<h2>PS...</h2>
			<ul class="rule">
				<li>
					If a row is locked during the public action, the other player can also cross out the number on the
					extreme right and lock that row at the same time.
					That player must also have crossed out at least five digits in that row earlier.
				</li>
			</ul>
