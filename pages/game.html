			<h3>Game Play</h3>
			<ul class="rule">
				<li>The first player to roll a 6 takes on the role of "active player". The active player rolls all six
					dice. The following two actions are now carried out in order,
					always one after the other:<br>
					The active player adds the two white dice together and declares the result aloud.
					All players may then cross out the number that the active player declared in any (but only one) of
					the color-rows (they are not obligated).
				</li>
				<li>
					The active player (but not the others) can then add one of the white dice to any of the colored dice
					and cross off the number corresponding to this total in the color-row corresponding to the color of
					the chosen die.
				</li>
				<h3>Penalties</h3>
				<li>If the active player does not cross out at least one number after the two acts, he must cross out
					one of the penalty boxes. At the end of the game, each penalty box is worth -5 points.
					(Non-active players do not receive a penalty for not crossing out a number.)
				</li>
				<h3>Locking a Row</h3>
				<li>
					To cross out the number at the far right end of a color-row (red 12, yellow 12, green 2, blue 2),
					you must first cross out at least five numbers from that row.
					If you cross out the number on the far right, you must also cross out the lock symbol immediately
					adjacent to it. This means that the color-row is now locked for all participants, and that numbers
					in this color may no longer be crossed out in subsequent rounds.
					The relevant color die is removed from the game right away.
				</li>
				<h3>PS...</h3>
				<li>
					If a row is locked during the initial action, additional players could cross out the number on the
					extreme right and lock the same color-row at the same time.
					These players must have crossed out at least five digits in that row earlier.
					<br><br> The number of crosses designated in that color-row is increased by the cross on the lock.
